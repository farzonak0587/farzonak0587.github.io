         <h1>Freedom Project: Biology in the Tech Age</h1>

  <section id="context">
    <h2>Context</h2>
    <p>This was a year-long project where we had to pick any topic we were interested in and connect it to technology. After choosing our topic, we had to research real-life software and hardware that are used in that field. Then, we also had to be creative and come up with future inventions that could be helpful one day.</p>
    <p>The main goal was to show how technology and our topic could work together now and in the future. Once we had all our research, we had to build a website using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and GitHub. We also had to teach ourselves a new coding tool or skill and use it on the site. The whole project was about combining tech with something we're passionate about, while learning how to research, design, and explain our ideas clearly.</p>
  </section>

  <section id="content">
    <h2>What I Made</h2>
    <p>For this project, I made a website called <strong>Biology in the Tech Age</strong>. The whole point of my site was to show how technology and biology are coming together to make a big impact in science, education, and medicine. I split my site into three main sections: software, hardware, and possible future inventions.</p>

    <p>In the software section, I researched and explained a bunch of apps that help people learn biology or use it in real life. Some of the apps were for students, like one that breaks down biology topics in a fun and easy way, and others were more advanced, like a tool that lets you design DNA sequences or see molecules in 3D. I picked apps that I thought were useful, explained what they do, and even linked to where you can learn more about them.</p>

    <p>In the hardware section, I focused on machines and tools that scientists and doctors use, like fluoroscopy (which is like a video X-ray), PCR machines that copy DNA, and gel electrophoresis, which separates DNA or proteins. I added real pictures, explained what each machine does, and talked about how they're used in the medical and biology world today.</p>

    <p>The last part was one of my favorites — future inventions. I had to come up with ideas that don’t exist yet but could be really useful. I created things like nanobots that can fix your DNA, smart tattoos that change color based on your health, and organ-on-a-chip devices that could help test medicine without using animals. I explained what each invention could do, how it might help people, and even how it could be removed or controlled.</p>

    <p>The whole website was made using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and GitHub, and I also learned Flexbox on my own to help with the layout. I made sure the site looked good, worked on mobile and desktop, and was easy to scroll through. I added a carousel to show off future tech images and made the sections organized so viewers could learn something new and stay interested.</p>

    <p>Overall, I wanted my website to be informative, fun to look at, and creative. It shows how biology and tech are combining now — and what could happen in the future.</p>

    <h2>Reflection</h2>

    <h3>Challenges</h3>
    <p>One of the biggest challenges I faced was making the navbar work well on smaller screens. At first, the mobile hamburger menu wasn’t working properly, and the navbar items would either overflow or not resize correctly on phones. I realized I hadn’t added the right classes and scripts to make the navbar collapse and expand properly on smaller devices. Once I fixed that by using Bootstrap’s built-in features for responsiveness, it worked much better.</p>
    <p>Another problem was with the carousel images and some text-heavy sections like "Software" and "Hardware." The images didn’t resize correctly and sometimes looked stretched or didn’t fill the space properly on mobile. The text also looked cluttered or overflowed outside its container. To fix this, I used media queries to adjust the image sizes and improve the layout for smaller screens. This made the website look much cleaner and easier to read on phones.</p>

    <h3>Takeaways</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Planning helps a ton.</strong> Making wireframes before I even started coding saved me a lot of time because I already had a clear idea of the layout.</li>
      <li><strong>Bootstrap is super useful.</strong> It made things like the navbar, carousel, and accordion way easier to build, so I didn’t have to code everything from scratch.</li>
      <li><strong>Flexbox = layout lifesaver.</strong> It helped keep all the sections neat and responsive, especially on mobile.</li>
      <li><strong>Mobile-first matters.</strong> My site looked messy on phones at first, but using media queries and Bootstrap’s responsive classes fixed that.</li>
      <li><strong>Small bugs can be big problems.</strong> The navbar issue was caused by missing classes and scripts, so debugging taught me to slow down and double-check my code carefully.</li>
      <li><strong>Content first makes design easier.</strong> Having my biology research ready before coding helped me focus on building the site without pausing to write content.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Next Steps</h3>
    <p>Moving forward, I want to try making another website from scratch. I’ll use what I learned here about planning, Bootstrap, Flexbox, and responsive design to make an even better site. I also want to try adding more interactive features with JavaScript to make the website more fun and engaging. Getting feedback from others will help me improve too.</p>
