            <h1>Context</h1>
            <p>
                For this project, I teamed up with a different partner to use everything we learned in Unit 2. We created a game where you have to choose different options, and by the end, you either become Spider-Man or not. We used our CLI, Git, and GitHub skills to put everything together. It was super fun because we got to practice working with these tools while making a cool game!
            </p>

            <h1>Content</h1>
            <p>
                For this project, we had to make a Google Drawing plan to show who was doing what and include a key. We also had to write a README that linked to the project’s start, the Google Drawing, and gave credits with links to our GitHub profiles. The project needed at least 10 files (not counting the README) and had to include at least one sub-directory. Lastly, we worked with a partner. Throughout the project, we practiced linking files and folders to other types of files, being creative by coming up with our own story for the game, and getting more familiar with using our IDE and working locally. It was a great way to get comfortable with organizing a project, managing versions, and collaborating with a partner.
            </p>

            <h1>Reflection</h1>

            <h2>Context</h2>
            <p>
                The teacher wanted us to collaborate and really remember how to use our CLI, Git, and GitHub skills because we had a lot of breaks in between learning them. He also wanted us to get more practice with these tools since we’re going to be using them all the time in the future.
            </p>

            <h2>Challenges</h2>

            <p>
                This project had a few challenges. One big challenge was communication. My partner and I didn’t know each other, and we weren’t friends, so it felt kinda awkward at first. But I decided to step out of my comfort zone and started talking to my partner. Once we got to know each other a little better, it became way easier to plan and work on the project together.
            </p>
            <p>
                Another challenge was the planning. We had to be really creative, and I’m not the best at coming up with creative ideas. But my partner helped out a lot by leading the brainstorming, and we came up with a good plan in the end. I’m glad it worked out because it turned out way better than I thought it would.
            </p>

            <h2>Next Steps</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    If I had more time, I would’ve tried to do the extra credit. I’m not really sure what grade I’ll get on this project, and the extra credit might have helped me out.
                </li>
                <li>
                    I also would’ve spent more time making the project look cooler. We didn’t have much time left since our weeks were super busy, and one of us wasn’t always in class.
                </li>
                <li>
                    If I had more time, I would’ve added pictures and other fun design stuff to make the project look more polished and interesting.
                </li>
            </ul>
